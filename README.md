3D printed wearable with OLED screen, powered by Adafruit Trinket M0.

The code for the LED needs to stay in if you want to shut off the built-in DotStar LED, which I recommend.
It gets about 4 hours from a full charge, maybe a little less.
I would recommend getting "all blue" OLED screens so that you don't have to worry about where the yellow ends.
The Trinket Pro is very depricated and doesn't work with Windows 10. Use the Trinket M0!
